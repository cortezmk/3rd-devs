    "thinking": give here your reasoning for the actions, i.e. action plan and what is yet to retrieve,
    "query": query to the database. It's going to be ran on DB engine. Valid queries are described in <query> section
    "answer": provide this entry only if you know the answer to user's question. It has to be in JSON array format directly in that field.
}
- user will respond with result from database by given query
- provide only one JSON object block. You will retrieve all the necessary responses for the queries in conversation
- provide the query only for the next step of resolving the task
- respond only with JSON. You can provide comments in "thinking" field.
